2880	4560	That was kind of fast, right?
5220	6620	Well, that's how we like to.
6660	10300	Bro, we have bought one of Europe's leading tech companies,
10820	12580	with almost 100 million customers.
13000	14000	And over 2,000 employees,
15080	18300	our company at this scale moves at this speed.
18780	19840	Here are some examples.
20420	23500	It took us five years to reach 10 million customers.
24200	26220	Now we're adding 10 million every two months.
27100	28600	Instead of reducing head count,
28600	33080	we added another 500 employees and launched.
33400	37600	Scooters and food delivery in 74 cities in 12 months.
38460	39520	But that wasn't enough.
39800	42540	So we launched car sharing with folks, drive,
42900	44380	and that took us four months.
45320	48420	And grocery delivery followed just one month later.
49060	51980	That's 2 new business lines in five months.
52500	53500	How did we do it?
53780	55520	Well, we don't spend time on bureaucracy.
55520	58560	Instead, we move across into more teams.
59000	60920	Teams, everybody acts like an owner.
61600	64300	So 13 owners launched both markets in one month.
64760	67240	So when others are doing this.
67800	69520	We're doing this.
73880	75700	As the company grows, so did we.
76060	77980	I started as a customer support specialist.
79400	81380	And now I'm originally lead.
82140	83420	And I started as a recruiter.
83900	86420	And now I'm a global recruiter for manager.
86700	88220	And I've been here for four and a half years.
88540	89420	Which is a bullet average.
90200	92220	That's one and a half years more than the industry average.
93160	94960	And I drew and bold when it was just a small,
95160	95960	a story on startup.
96360	98360	And also what was fast is growing when we needed to blood for.
100420	101120	Let's go.
